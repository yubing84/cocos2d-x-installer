1.2 Subject to the terms of this License Agreement, Chukong grants you a limited, worldwide, royalty­free, non­assignable, revocable and non­exclusive license to use CocoStudio solely to develop applications and games on your target platforms (each individually, an “Application,” and collectively, the “Applications”).
